Install mining on ubuntu server  

 

First things first, as a prerequisite you should have installed a linux distribution ( eg. Ubuntu , Debian ) , whether this is on your own hardware or a VPS doesn't matter. 

 

Instructions on how to install / deploy Linux as a VPS should be provided by the VPS supplier 

 

You should have posession of a root account on this server, aswell as ssh access to the terminal 

 

This tutorial is based on a debian 12 linux installation 

 

You can find installation instructions for debian here:   ( in case of installation on your own hardware )

====================================================== 

Once logged in on the terminal of the linux server we need to take the following steps  

 

Create a folder were we install xmrig,  normally the /opt folder is were you put software, but this can be any folder ( for example your home dir  ( /home/user )  

 

# mkdir /opt/xmrig 

# cd /opt/xmrig 

  

Download the latest release of xlarig from github 

 

# wget https://github.com/scala-network/XLArig/releases/download/v5.2.4/xlarig-v5.2.4-linux-x86_64.zip 

Since the xlarig is a zip file, we need to install unzip ( if not present )   

 

# apt install unzip 

 Then we can unzip the application 

 

# unzip xlarig-v5.2.4-linux-x86_64.zip 

 

Next, you can put the command in a bash file ( similar to a windows .bat or .cmd file )  

 

# nano mine.sh  

 

The editor opens and now you can put the folowing in the script 

  

/opt/xlarig/xlarig --donate-level 1 -o [pool address] -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE -p WORKER_NAME -a panthera –k 

 

To start mining simply type ( in the /opt/xlarig folder)    

#sh mine.sh 

Be aware this now runs in the foreground, so when you hit CTRL-C it will stop. To start in background use following command 

 

# sh mine.sh .& 

 

Alternatively you can configure this to start whenever you reboot by editing the crontab file  

 

# crontab -e 

 

@reboot /opt/xlarig/xlarig --donate-level 1 -o [pool address] -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE -p WORKER_NAME -a panthera –k
